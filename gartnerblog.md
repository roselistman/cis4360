Benefits of Microservices:  
  Can deploy individual apps when ready  
  Can scale specific parts up or down  
  Reduces risk and increases resiliency  
  Agility/flexibility  
  Can have different levels of granularity (macroservice, miniservice, microservice)  
  **Most beneficial if you need continuous delivery and need a lot of scaling  
  
Costs of Microservices:  
  Large upfront investment  
  Need skillful employees  
  Cultural changes  
    Product mindset, team autonomy  
  Changes in data management techniques  
  **Highly disruptive  
  
Risks of Implementation:  
  Poor performance  
    Many organizations do not have success because they don't fully embrace microservices and instead to a micro/macro combination  
  
Early Adopters:  
  Netflix, Amazon, Twitter  
  iHeartRadio, Soundcloud, LinkedIn, Pinterest, eBay, Airbnb, Uber  
  Need scalability and to improve features quickly  
  
My Opinion:  
  Implementation is high cost and high risk. Organizations shouldn't necessarily go for it unless they would really benefit from the increased agility and flexibility and decide that improvement is worth the cost of all of the technological and cultural changes as well as the finacial risk. Before implementation, organizations should do a lot of research and develop the required skills internally. They should also consider intermediary steps like encapsuling their existing applications or creating miniservices as was stated in the report.
